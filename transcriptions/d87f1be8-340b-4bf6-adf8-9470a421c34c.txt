 Hi, I'm here to talk about hosting your next website with AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that enables front-end web and mobile developers to build secure, scalable, full-stack applications powered by AWS. Let's get started. In the AWS Management Console, search for AWS Amplify. Next, click Get Started Under Deliver. Here, choose Deploy Without Get Provider and then click Continue. Next, give your app a name, your environment a name, and drag your app code directly into the console. To Deploy, click Save and Deploy. When the deployment is complete, click on your domain to see it live on AWS.
